----- Design pattern / Performance improvements suggestions -----

Folder / File naming conventions (non jsx) - (e.g, chat-settings)
Loaders for every useEffect state updates
Include useCallbacks hook for big functions / conditional rendering logics
Abstract the logics inside useEffects outside and memoize it incase "if large computations needed" (useMemo hook)
Custom hooks are preferred in scenarios with numerous states and useEffects
Abstract all the non businees logics (data transformations / manipulations) outside the jsx files and it needs to be placed under an "utility directory" for reusability
All third-party library APIs should be wrapped inside a wrapper function and used consistently throughout the app
Dynamic imports are preferred for bigger components to reduce bundle size (Should be avoided for smaller components / utility functions)
Conditional checks are preferred inside useEffects to reduce re-rendering
In future if a lot of third party libraries are needed, (reliable and trust worthy libraries are preferred
